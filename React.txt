# What is Hooks
Hooks are special functions, that allow us to use state and other React features in functional components.
Earlier, when we used to create react app using Functional component, then we didn't have access to the state management and lifecycle methods.
to access these features we had to add class components
so this was the problem with functional component.
But after introducing React Hooks from version 16.8, we can use state management and other react features without writing class components.
In other words, Hooks are the functions that make functinal components work like class components.
Hooks made react functional component so easy to use.
Developers prefer functional components over class components.

# Benefits of React Hooks
React hooks simplify the code, improves the readability, reusability and overall performance of the application.
Most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, useContext, useReducer, useLayoutEffect, custom hooks

useState - It is a reack hook, which creates on "state variable". Which helps us to track state in components & updates the use interface when state changes.
